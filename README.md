## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Algorithm Selection:
  - A* Search (heuristic-based, optimal path)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm (uniform exploration, shortest path)
  - Breadth-First Search (level-by-level)
  - Depth-First Search (deep exploration, backtracking)
  - Bidirectional Search (search from both start & end)

- 🏗️ Maze Configuration:
  - Adjustable maze sizes (10x10 → 50x50)
  - Recursive Backtracking maze generation
  - Edit mode (draw walls, place start/end, or view-only)

- 🎥 Visualization:
  - Adjustable animation speed
  - Step-by-step or instant solving
  - Compare all algorithms simultaneously

- 🎓 Educational Tool:
  - Highlights explored nodes, path, start, end, and walls
  - Helps learners understand algorithm behavior & efficiency
